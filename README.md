# Photo-Investor-Sentiment-data-from-Bloomberg-for-the-Chinese-Stock-Market
A collection of Photo Investor Sentiment indicators for the Chinese stock market, including monthly (MPIS), biweekly (BPIS), and daily (DPIS) variants. These indicators are derived from Bloomberg news photos by using a deep learning model. The Photo Investor Sentiment (PIS) is defined as the proportion of photo sam ples classified as negative within a given time frame.
These three variants enable us to quantify the China-specific investor sentiment that captures the beliefs of international investors toward the Chinese market, and examine effects of the investor sentiment on the Chinese stock market.

The data of MPIS can be found in MPIS.csv.
The data of BPIS can be found in BPIS.csv.
The data of DPIS can be found in DPIS.csv.
